      Data custodians can display the availability of data categories across multiple research studies.  
      The app enables researchers to explore and visualise data from participants that 
      match certain criteria or interests, 
      which are applied using filters at study and participant levels.  
      Simulated data are used for demonstration purposes.
      The development of this app is described in Chen et al. [citation]. 
      The scripts are open source, but we ask that you kindly acknowledge our work.
