# Welcome to DataRepExp
DataRepExp is an Open-Source R Shiny app developed to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) of research data hosted on a data repository.

This software was inspired by the visualization tool developed by [Dementias Platform UK](https://www.dementiasplatform.uk/) using PowerBI, developed for the [Dementias Platform Australia](https://www.dementiasplatform.com.au/), and can be utilised by other data repositories.


With this app, data repositories can display standardized metadata including the availability of data across multiple research studies. It provides an interactive data visualization tool for some commonly used variables in the field, allowing researchers to explore and visualize data from participants that match certain criterias, which are applied using filters at both study and participant levels. 

Simulated data are used for demonstration purposes.

The demo app can be found here: https://rorychenxy.shinyapps.io/DataRepExp/
